# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

* [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
